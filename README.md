Ideas for Your Portfolio Website
Interactive Cards: Make each project's card interactive. On hover, the card could slightly enlarge, show a brief description, or change its shadow, signaling that it's clickable.
Filtering Options: Implement filtering by technology used (e.g., HTML/CSS, JavaScript, React) so visitors can quickly find projects relevant to their interests.
Modal or Lightbox: Instead of directly linking to the project, you could open a modal or lightbox with more details about the project and a link to visit the full site. This keeps visitors on your portfolio longer.
Animations: Subtle animations on loading your portfolio can draw attention to your projects effectively. Consider using CSS animations or libraries like AOS (Animate On Scroll) for this.
Testimonials or Client Feedback: If applicable, include a section for client feedback or testimonials about your work. This adds credibility.
Contact Form: A simple form or your professional contact details, making it easy for potential clients or employers to reach you.
Responsive Design: Ensure your website is fully responsive, adjusting beautifully to any screen size, from mobile devices to large desktops.
Accessibility: Make sure your website is accessible, including proper use of semantic HTML, alt tags for images, and accessible navigation.
